<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>When you use ABCDelivery, you trust us with your personal data. We’re committed to keeping that trust. That starts with helping you understand our privacy practices.</p>
<p>This notice describes the personal data (“data”) we collect, how it’s used and shared, and your choices regarding this data. We recommend that you read this, which highlights key points about our privacy practices.</p>
<h2>II. Overview</h2>

<h3>A. Scope</h3>
<p>This notice applies to users of ABCDelivery’s services anywhere in the world, including users of ABCDelivery’s apps, websites, features, or other services.</p>
<p>This notice describes how ABCDelivery collect and use data. This notice applies to all ABCDelivery users. This notice specifically applies to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vendors: individuals who request or receive parcel delivery and related services via their ABCDelivery account.</li></p>
<li><p>Order recipients: individuals who request or receive food or other products and services for delivery or pick-up via their ABCDelivery account.</li></p>
<li><p>Delivery persons: individuals who provide delivery services via ABCDelivery.</li></p> 
</ul>
<p>This notice also governs ABCDelivery’s other collections of data in connection with its services. For example, we may collect the contact information of owners or employees of restaurants or other merchants on the ABCDelivery platform; the contact information of individuals that manage and use accounts owned by Enterprise Customers; or data of individuals who start but do not complete their applications to be drivers or delivery persons.</p>
<p>All those subject to this notice are referred to as “users” in this notice.</p>
<p>Our privacy practices are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. This means that we engage in the practices described in this notice in a particular country or region only if permitted under the laws of those places. Currently we are only operating in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Please write us at with any questions regarding our practices in a particular country or region.</p>
<p>ABCDelivery operates, and processes personal data; wherever and whenever you travel, your data travels with you so we can offer you a seamless experience. We also respect your data protection rights no matter where ever you are.</p>
<p>We never transfer personal data to countries other than your home country. Because our services involve multiple users at the same time but within just Pakistan now, so not even limited personal data can be accessible to the other user in another country.</p>
<p>We do so in order to fulfill our agreements with all of our users, or based on users’ instructions or prior consent, adequacy decisions, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>
<p>But we may transfer data within the country in order to respond to a request for personal data from a law enforcement agency. To provide additional safeguards to these data transfers, ABCDelivery applies a robust internal procedure for processing these requests. ABCDelivery only discloses personal data to law enforcement agencies in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory requirements of applicable laws.</p>
<p>To help provide equivalent data protection wherever you use our services, ABCDelivery has implemented the following measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>policies and procedures to limit access to, and the processing of personal data for defined purposes;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For your convenience, the exercise of your data protection rights can be directed to ABCDelivery via any of the designated channels mentioned above, and will be handled centrally on behalf of the relevant controller. Questions, comments, and complaints about ABCDelivery’s data practices can be submitted on the email given below. You may also submit a question to ABCDelivery’s Data Protection Officer and to ask us for a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses or other transfer mechanisms in place for the data processing activity of your inquiry.</p>
